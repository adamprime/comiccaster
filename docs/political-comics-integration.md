# Political Comics Integration for ComicCaster v1.1

## Overview

ComicCaster v1.1 adds support for political editorial cartoons from GoComics, expanding from 404+ daily syndicated comics to include 63 additional political cartoonists. This document describes the implementation following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Key Components

### 1. Political Comics Discovery (`scripts/discover_political_comics.py`)

Automatically discovers all political comics from GoComics' political cartoons A-Z page.

**Features:**
- Fetches comics from https://www.gocomics.com/political-cartoons/political-a-to-z
- Parses JSON-LD structured data for accurate comic information
- Handles errors gracefully with empty list fallback
- Deduplicates comics automatically
- Saves results to `political_comics_list.json`

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/discover_political_comics.py
```

### 2. Publishing Schedule Analyzer (`scripts/analyze_publishing_schedule.py`)

Analyzes comic publishing patterns to optimize update frequencies.

**Features:**
- Detects publishing patterns: daily, weekdays, weekly, semi-weekly, irregular
- Provides confidence scores for pattern detection
- Recommends optimal update strategies (daily, weekly, smart)
- Handles comics with no publishing history

**Pattern Detection:**
- **Daily**: Comics published 7 days/week (e.g., Clay Jones, Doonesbury)
- **Weekly**: Comics published once per week (e.g., Brian McFadden)
- **Semi-weekly**: Comics published 2-3 times per week (e.g., Chris Britt)
- **Irregular**: Variable schedule requiring smart detection (e.g., Al Goodwyn, Bill Bramhall)

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/analyze_publishing_schedule.py
```

### 3. Setup Script (`scripts/setup_political_comics.py`)

Combined discovery and analysis workflow with progress tracking.

**Features:**
- Discovers all political comics
- Analyzes publishing schedules with rate limiting
- Provides detailed progress logging
- Saves comprehensive results with update recommendations

**Usage:**
```bash
# Analyze sample of 5 comics (default)
python scripts/setup_political_comics.py

# Analyze specific number of comics
python scripts/setup_political_comics.py --sample-size 10

# Analyze all 63 comics (takes ~5-10 minutes)
python scripts/setup_political_comics.py --analyze-all
```

## Data Format

Political comics are stored in `political_comics_list.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Al Goodwyn Editorial Cartoons",
  "slug": "algoodwyn",
  "url": "https://www.gocomics.com/algoodwyn",
  "author": "Al Goodwyn Editorial Cartoons",
  "position": 1,
  "is_political": true,
  "publishing_frequency": {
    "type": "irregular",
    "days_per_week": 4,
    "average_gap_days": 1.67,
    "confidence": 0.5,
    "publishes_on_weekends": true
  },
  "update_recommendation": "smart"
}
```

## Key Findings

From analysis of political comics:

### Publishing Patterns
- **Daily comics (2)**: Clay Jones, Doonesbury - publish 7 days/week
- **Weekly comics (1)**: Brian McFadden - publishes once per week
- **Semi-weekly comics (1)**: Chris Britt - publishes 2-3 times/week
- **Irregular comics (5)**: Most political cartoonists have variable schedules
- **Unknown (1)**: Bob Gorrell - no recent comics found

### Update Strategy Recommendations
- **Daily update**: Comics with daily or unknown patterns
- **Weekly update**: Comics with weekly patterns
- **Smart update**: Comics with irregular or semi-weekly patterns (adaptive checking)

## Test Coverage

All components were developed using TDD with comprehensive test suites:

- `tests/test_political_comics_discovery.py` - 7 tests for discovery functionality
- `tests/test_publishing_analyzer.py` - 10 tests for schedule analysis

All 17 tests pass with proper mocking of external HTTP requests.

## Integration with Existing System

### Shared Components

1. **HTTP Client** (`comiccaster/http_client.py`)
   - Shared session with retry logic
   - Common headers and error handling
   - Used by both discovery and analysis scripts

2. **Feed Generation**
   - Political comics use the same RSS feed generation as syndicated comics
   - Compatible with existing `ComicFeedGenerator` class

### Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Update `scripts/update_feeds.py`**
   - Load both `comics_list.json` and `political_comics_list.json`
   - Apply smart scheduling based on `update_recommendation`
   - Skip comics with `unknown` frequency until data available

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Implement tabbed interface in `public/index.html`
   - Add tab state management and filtering
   - Update OPML generation to respect tab selection

3. **Deployment**
   - Run `setup_political_comics.py --analyze-all` initially
   - Update GitHub Actions to include political comics
   - Monitor feed generation performance

## Performance Considerations

- Analysis uses rate limiting (1s delay between batches)
- Concurrent processing limited to 4 workers for respectful scraping
- HTTP client includes retry logic with exponential backoff
- 404 errors are expected for dates without comics

## Error Handling

The system gracefully handles:
- Network errors → Returns empty lists
- Missing comics → Marks as "unknown" frequency
- Rate limiting → Automatic retry with backoff
- Parsing errors → Logged but doesn't stop processing
