  "description": "In what appears to be a nostalgic sequel to the 2020 election circus, the Trump administration is once again stirring up anxiety among state and local election officials\u2014this time with sweeping requests for voter rolls and behind-the-scenes attempts to inspect voting machines. The Justice Department has asked at least nine states to hand over voter data, while a former aide to Rep. Lauren Boebert has been cold-calling Colorado clerks, claiming he's working with the White House on an \u201celection integrity\u201d project that suspiciously resembles federal meddling."
